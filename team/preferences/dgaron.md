# Preferences for Daniel Garon

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text, after 4 PM on weekdays, 10 AM - 10 PM on weekends.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect that we will work together well and complete all of the assigned tasks.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My goal is to provide any help I can to ensure nobody on the team struggles to do their part.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * We may have differing standards for the assigned tasks and we may have to compromise.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I will attempt to convince the team that we shouldn't settle because we are capable of getting the A.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * If that's what it takes, then we may have to accept it.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I don't know that I can estimate that without more details on the project.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I would suggest starting by allowing people to select tasks based on strengths. We will reevaluate if that doesn't work.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * The other members of the team will intervene.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We will discuss the requirements and the text and try to agree on a reasonable compromise.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * We will make dependencies clear so that nobody is prevented from completing their tasks.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think it sounds like a good idea.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I suppose this depends on the details of the project and the workload. I'd say at least weekly, probably more.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * We can discuss any significant decisions during team meetings and see if anyone has concerns.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * I will do my best to hear their concern and communicate my own. Hopefully they can understand that the team needs to move forward.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * I will tell them that we need to allow everyone to contribute. If it's me, say something.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will communicate that to the team.

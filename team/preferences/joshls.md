# Preferences for Josh Ellis

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__
   * Email. I have a preferred work email, but we can use CSU's if we need to. I can work between 8 AM and 9 PM, but please don't expect me to check my CSU email more than once or twice a day. I'll let the team decide how to do this.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__
   * I expect the team to do as well as it can. I'm hoping for an "A".
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__
   * I hope to improve my teamwork well enough to work on a real software development team. I don't know enough about teamwork to give specifics.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__
   * Honestly, I have fairly poor social skills going into the team, so that might make teamwork harder for me.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an "A" while others think a "B" will be acceptable?__
   * I'm not sure. While I do want on "A", I don't want to overwork people who have honest outside commitments.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an "A"?__
   * It depends on how much more work. I'd expect some variation anyway, so some more work for certain team members is expected. If the "A" wanting students are doing way more work than expected (e.g. 50% more), this probably isn't acceptable.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__
   * I have no idea. I can't commit much more than 10 hours a week to this class.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__
   * If I were in charge, I'd assign tasks to whoever is best in that area.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn't follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__
   * I'm not sure what the best approach here is. I might ask a teammate to deal with it or bring it up in a meeting.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__
   * I think it depends on the situation and how reasonable the demands are.
   Something like having indentation should be implemented, but at some point, we'll just have to commit the code since some people will never agree on good practice.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__
   * As long as team members honor their commitments and don't disrupt anything, I actually don't care about their work habits.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__
   * Yes. My schedule actually allows me to meet with the team during the in-class meetings over a phone or video call, so this can work too.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__
   * I'd guess somewhere between once and three times a week.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__
   * No. We can put this to debates and votes for big issues, and the two-person system for small issues.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__
   * It depends. If it's possible to accommodate this team member, that's good. Otherwise, I'd just move on and do what the rest of the team agrees on.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__
   * I'd try to bring it up with this person in private.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__
   * I'll bring it up with Professor Matthews if this happens.

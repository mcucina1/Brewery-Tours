## Planned Epics


<h3>Introduction</h3>
We as a team are introcucing who we are. We're representing ourselves to the customer by adding information about each other so that they feel more in touch with our members.  
<br>
<br>
The Team Identification epic will provide the user with information about the team. We will provide the name of the team. We will also present the team name in the browser tab, HTML title, and in the application header & footer.
<br>
<br>
Our About epic focuses on presenting basic information about our team and about ourselves. Each bio and image is added individually per team member, while our team image is added through team effort.

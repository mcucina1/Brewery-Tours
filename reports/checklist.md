# Inspection Checklist for t10

The goal of an Inspection is to find defects in your code.
This checklist is our guide to help us look for common code defects.
The checklist will be updated as we identify new faults in our code that we wish to prevent in future inspections.


### Data faults
* Are all program variables initialized before their values are used?
* Have all constants been named?
* Should the upper bound of arrays be equal to the size of the array or size-1?
* If character strings are used, is a delimiter explicitly assigned?
* Is there any possibility of a buffer overflow?

### Control faults
* For each conditional statement, is the condition correct?
* Is each loop certain to terminate?
* Are compound statements correctly bracketed?
* In case statements, are all possible cases accounted for?
* If a break is required after each case in case statements, has it been included?

### Parameter faults
* Are all input variables used?
* Are values assigned to all output variables before they are output?
* Can unexpected inputs cause corruption?

### Interface faults
* Do all functions and methods have the correct number of parameters?
* Do formal and actual parameter types match?
* Are the parameters in the right order?
* Do all components use a consistent model for shared memory structure?

### Storage faults
* If a linked structure is modified, have all links been correctly diagnosed?
* If dynamic storage is used, has space been allocated correctly?
* Is space explicitly deallocated after it is no longer required?

### Exception faults
* Have all possible error conditions been considered?

We are Random Code Generators, a team consisting of 5 people, Daniel, Ben, Eric, Josh, and Michael writing code non-randomly for a mobile trip planning application. The following paragraphs will explain how we're planning to work together.  
  
We will each contribute time to the project daily. Our goal is to complete tasks well before deadlines. We are confident that effective time management will contribute to our success.  
  
Generally our team's experience is overall spread to different areas that combine together to make a solid team. Some of us have more team experience, and some of us have more solo coding experience. For example, Josh has more Github experience and Daniel has more JavaScript experience. Where some of us may lack experience, others have more experience to bring together a diverse, but strong team.
  
Our goal concerning our workflow is to evenly divide the work between each member. Each of us will contribute a fair amount to complete our tasks and finish our sprints. We plan on averaging around an hour a day of work contributed. We will strive to complete our tasks on time and to the best of our capabilites, while helping each other along the way.

We look foward to work on this project and have fun will doing so. Together we plan on gaining more coding experience and team work skills by supporting each other. We will try to not randomly generate code successfully.
